#### Bardic Inspiration
* Is now a reaction when somebody fails a d20 roll rather than a BA on your turn
* Duration has increased to 1 hour from 10 minutes

#### Countercharm
* Changed from action, to reaction when a creature within 30 feet fails a saving throw against a charm or frighten effect
* When reaction triggers, causes target who failed to remake saving throw w/ advantage.

#### Font of Inspiration
* Allows you to expend a spell slots 1/turn (no action) to get 1 use of bardic inspiration

#### Magical Secrets
* Relies on arcane/primal/divine spell lists so this ability since Playtest 6 does not work...
TODO fill this in.

#### Spellcasting
* Playtest 6 it was related to spell lists
* Since playtest 7 they have dropped arcane/primal/divine spell lists so this feature doesn't work
* TODO fill this in once we know
* At the moment, assume, only Bard Spell list

#### Superior Inspiration
* was now a 20th level feature, now is 18th level
* When you roll initiative with no uses of inspiration, you regain 2

#### Words of Creation
* New 20th level feature replacing Superior Inspiration
* You therefore always have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill spells prepared, and when you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with the spell, provided that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.
    * Note Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill had spell changes in this UA which make this more viable/useful
