Document listing all changes in a short form for upgrading from 5e to oneDND

You'll probably need to still look at the playtest documents for the exact wording but this is meant to be a quick and up to date reference of what's changed so far

There's probably mistakes if you find them, easily make suggestions here and I'll approve them.

I also haven't done any of the subclasses, they're pretty short anyways and if you want to play them most of them have been so redesigned it's more worthwhile to just read the UA document directly.  If somebody wants to put them in here, be my guest.

## Species
* Renamed from Races
* There's a bunch of changes I don't care to go over them
* Important thing to know is that they no longer grant you racial ASI bonuses those are instead granted by your background which you can choose or create your own of.


## Bastions
Just look up the [bastions document](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest8) or wait for them to comeout, they're new stronghold rules and nothing we've seen before, doesn't make sense to repeat them here.
