This is a reference for most of the changes between 5e and oneDND.  This is not intended as a source of truth or for exact wording, instead just as a quick reference when discussing UA changes.

There's probably mistakes if you find them, raise an issue or make a pull request and they'll be fixed.

Things not listed here:
* Every Single Rule re-wording
    * In order to keep the document short I only included what I felt were important rule changes
* Sub-classes
    * Most are so different you'll need to read the actual released version anyways, and it would've been a bunch more work that I don't care to do.
* Species/Race Changes 
    * I just couldn't be bothered

* Important thing to know is that they no longer grant you racial ASI bonuses those are instead granted by your background which you can choose or create your own of.


## Bastions
Just look up the [bastions document](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest8) or wait for them to comeout, they're new stronghold rules and nothing we've seen before, doesn't make sense to repeat them here.
