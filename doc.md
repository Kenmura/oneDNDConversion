Document listing all changes in a short form for upgrading from 5e to oneDND

You'll probably need to still look at the playtest documents for the exact wording but this is meant to be a quick and up to date reference of what's changed so far

There's probably mistakes if you find them, easily make suggestions here and I'll approve them.

I also haven't done any of the subclasses, they're pretty short anyways and if you want to play them most of them have been so redesigned it's more worthwhile to just read the UA document directly.  If somebody wants to put them in here, be my guest.

#### Spellcasting

    * Twinned Spell: Redesigned entirely, developer explanation:
        > The 2014 version was too powerful, since it basically allowed you to cast two spells on the same turn (as in Quickened Spell) and to cast the extra spell with a Sorcery Point discount (for example, a 3rd-level Spell Slot normally costs 5 Sorcery Points, but in Twinned Spell, it cost only 3). The targeting limitation of Twinned Spell failed to contain how overpowered the option was and caused confusion. The new version of Twinned Spell keeps the Sorcery Point discount, with Quickened Spell carrying the extra-spell-on-a-turn weight. This redesign has allowed us to remove the targeting limitation that Twinned Spell had before.
        * New Version: Cost 1-5 sorcery points; When you cast a spell of 1st–5th level that you also cast on your previous turn by expending a Spell Slot, you can fuel this turn’s casting of the spell by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level rather than expending a Spell Slot

* In addition, if you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

#### Spellcasting
* New sorcerer specific spells Sorcerous Burst and Arcane Eruption
* The number of total prepared spells goes up to 22 from 15 at level 20(matching clerics and druids) for total prepared at one time (although sorcerers aren't prepared casters).
    * Generally over the course of play you will have more spells than a 5e sorcerer

### Counterspell
* Now requires target to make a con save, rather than caster making spellcaster ability check
* You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn’t expended.
* Developer reasoning:
    > the spell’s previous design failed to account for the capabilities of the target, which is rectified by the new design. The new design also specifies that the countered spell must be cast with spell components, and if the countered spell used a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended.

### Weapon Property

#### Light
* Redefiend Light weapon property as the following:
> When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage, unless that modifier is negative. For example, if you take the Attack action on your turn and have a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other—each of which has the Light property—you can make one attack with each weapon, using your action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action, unless that modifier is negative.

#### Thrown
* Allows you to draw a weapon as a part of the ranged attack
* Redefined Thrown weapon property as the following:
> If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the Finesse property.

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a
creature, you can deal damage to that creature

increased in any way, other than increasing the
ability modifier.

#### Nick Mastery Property

property, you can make it as part of the Attack

make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Vex Mastery Property

damage to the creature, you have Advantage on
