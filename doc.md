Document listing all changes in a short form for upgrading from 5e to oneDND

You'll probably need to still look at the playtest documents for the exact wording but this is meant to be a quick and up to date reference of what's changed so far

There's probably mistakes if you find them, easily make suggestions here and I'll approve them.

* TODO fill this in once we know

* When you roll initiative with no uses of inspiration, you regain 2

#### Words of Creation
* New 20th level feature replacing Superior Inspiration

    * Note Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill had spell changes in this UA which make this more viable/useful

### Cleric

#### Blessed Strikes
* new 7th level feature
* Replaces in subclass the Divine Strike and Potent Cantrips features typically shown in subclasses
* Grants cleric the ablity to choose between them, rather than being restricted based on subclass

#### Spellcasting
* Your spell preparation is now determined by the Spells prepared column in the Cleric Leveling Table
    * It is about how many spells you'd probably have typically as a cleric by prioritizing wisdom at lower levels, but beyond level 11, it is anywhere from 1 to 3 less levels than you'd probably have prepared for a 5e cleric
    * Essentially your prepared spells at lower levels won't change much, but at higher levels it'll be slightly more restricted
    * Its actually the same progression that oneDND bard gets

* Developer reasoning:
    > the spell’s previous design failed to account for the capabilities of the target, which is rectified by the new design. The new design also specifies that the countered spell must be cast with spell components, and if the countered spell used a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended.

#### Trident

#### War Pick

### Weapon Property

#### Light
* Redefiend Light weapon property as the following:
> When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage, unless that modifier is negative. For example, if you take the Attack action on your turn and have a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other—each of which has the Light property—you can make one attack with each weapon, using your action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action, unless that modifier is negative.

#### Thrown
* Allows you to draw a weapon as a part of the ranged attack
* Redefined Thrown weapon property as the following:
> If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the Finesse property.

### Weapon Masteries
* All weapons now have mastery properties

this weapon, you can make an attack roll with

#### Graze Mastery Property
*Prereq: Heavy melee weapon*
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a
creature, you can deal damage to that creature

increased in any way, other than increasing the
ability modifier.

Prone condition.

#### Vex Mastery Property

damage to the creature, you have Advantage on
